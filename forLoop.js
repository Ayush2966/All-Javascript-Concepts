// Because this pattern is so common, JavaScript and similar languages provide
// a slightly shorter and more comprehensive form, the for loop.

let sum = 0
for (let index = 0; index <= 10; index++) {
    sum+=index
}
console.log(sum)


// continue use to contine the next iteration of loop , whenever loop come across continue 
//the loop continues from next iteration without going further

// break use to break the loop , whenever loop come across the break statement loops endss..
